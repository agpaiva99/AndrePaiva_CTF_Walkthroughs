Creating an environment variable called IP and assigning it the value of the machine.

```
$ export IP=10.10.6.219
```

**Using Nmap to Identify Service Versions and Gather Additional Information:**

To discover the services running on open ports and gather more information using default scripts, I used the following Nmap command:

```
$ nmap -sV -sC $IP
Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-07-11 09:42 -03
Nmap scan report for 10.10.6.219
Host is up (0.24s latency).
Not shown: 996 closed ports
PORT    STATE SERVICE     VERSION
22/tcp  open  ssh         OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp  open  http        Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
139/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
445/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 57.35 seconds
```
**Key Findings:**

    Open Ports: Identified four open ports (22, 80, 139, 445).
    HTTP Server: Discovered an Apache HTTP server (version 2.4.29) running on port 80.
    Samba Server: Detected Samba services on ports 139 and 445.
    SSH Service: Found an OpenSSH service on port 22.

With this information, I determined I decided my next steps to explore the machine are the following

    Directory Enumeration: I used Gobuster to search for hidden directories or files on the web server.
    Vulnerability Scanning: I ran Nikto to check the Apache server for known vulnerabilities.
    Share enumeration: I used enum4linux to gather more information about Samba shares and users:
